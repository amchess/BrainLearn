## Overview

BrainLearn is a free, powerful UCI chess engine derived from BrainFish ([https://zipproth.de/Brainfish/download/](https://zipproth.de/Brainfish/download/)). It is not a complete chess program and requires a UCI-compatible GUI (e.g. XBoard with PolyGlot, Scid, Cute Chess, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, Shredder, Chess Partner or Fritz) in order to be used comfortably. Read the documentation for your GUI of choice for information about how to use Stockfish with it.

## Files

This distribution of BrainLearn consists of the following files:

- Readme.md, the file you are currently reading.
- Copying.txt, a text file containing the GNU General Public License version 3.
- src, a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile that can be used to compile BrainLearn on Unix-like systems.

## UCI parameters

BrainLearn hash the same options as BrainFish, but it implements a persisted learning algorithm, managing a file named experience.bin.

It is a collection of one or more positions stored with the following format (similar to in memory Stockfish Transposition Table):

- _best move_
- _board signature (hash key)_
- _best move depth_
- _best move score_
- _best move performance_ , a new parameter you can calculate with any learning application supporting this specification. An example is the private one, kernel of SaaS part of [Alpha-Chess](http://www.alpha-chess.com) AI portal. The idea is to calculate it based on pattern recognition concept. In the portal, you can also exploit the reports of another NLG (virtual trainer) application and buy the products in the digishop based on all this. This open-source part has the performance default. So, it doesn't use it. Clearly, even if already strong, this private learning algorithm is a lot stronger as demostrate here: [Graphical result](https://github.com/amchess/BrainLearn/tree/master/tests/6-5.jpg)

This file is loaded in an hashtable at the engine load and updated each time the engine receive quit or stop uci command.
When BrainLearn starts a new game or when we have max 8 pieces on the chessboard, the learning is activated and the hash table updated each time the engine has a best score
at a depth >= 4 PLIES, according to Stockfish aspiration window.

At the engine loading, there is an automatic merge to experience.bin files, if we put the other ones, based on the following convention:

&lt;fileType&gt;&lt;qualityIndex&gt;.bin

where

- _fileType=&quot;experience&quot;/&quot;bin&quot;_
- _qualityIndex_ , an integer, incrementally from 0 on based on the file&#39;s quality assigned by the user (0 best quality and so on)

N.B.

Because of disk access, to be effective, the learning must be made at no bullet time controls (less than 5 minutes/game).

#### Contempt
The default value is 0 and keep it for analysis purpose. For game playing, you can use the default stockfish value 24

#### Dynamic contempt

_Boolean, Default: True_ For match play, activate it and the engine uses the dynamic contempt. For analysis purpose; keep it at its default, to completely avoid, with contempt settled to 0, the well known [rollercoaster effect](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=69129) and align so the engine's score to the gui's informator symbols

### Read only learning

_Boolean, Default: False_ 
If activated, the learning file is only read.

### Self Q-learning

_Boolean, Default: False_ 
If activated, the learning algorithm is the [Q-learning](https://youtu.be/qhRNvCVVJaA?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xoWNVdDudn51XM8lOuZ_Njv), optimized for self play. Some GUIs don't write the experience file in some game's modes because the uci protocol is differently implemented

### MonteCarlo Tree Search section (experimental: thanks to original Stephan Nicolet work)
#### MCTS (checkbox)

_Boolean, Default: False_ If activated, the engine uses the MonteCarlo Tree Search in the manner specified by the following parameters.

#### MCTSThreads

_Integer, Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 512_
The number of settled threads to use for MCTS search except the first (main) one always for alpha-beta search. 
In particular, if the number is greater than threads number, they will all do a montecarlo tree search, always except the first (main) for alpha-beta search.

#### Multi Strategy 

_Integer, Default: 20, Min: 0, Max: 100_ 
Only in multi mcts mode, for tree policy.

#### Multi MinVisits

_Integer, Default: 5, Min: 0, Max: 1000_
Only in multi mcts mode, for Upper Confidence Bound.

### Book management section (thanks to Khalid Omar)
The order is: bin->ctg->live book

#### CTG/BIN Book 1 File
The file name of the first book file which could be a polyglot (BIN) or Chessbase (CTG) book. To disable this book, use: ```<empty>```
If the book (CTG or BIN) is in a different directory than the engine executable, then configure the full path of the book file, example:
```C:\Path\To\My\Book.ctg``` or ```/home/username/path/to/book/bin```

#### Book 1 Width
The number of moves to consider from the book for the same position. To play best book move, set this option to ```1```. If a value ```n``` (greater than ```1```) is configured, the engine will pick **randomly** one of the top ```n``` moves available in the book for the given position

#### Book 1 Depth
The maximum number of moves to play from the book
	
#### (CTG) Book 1 Only Green
This option is only used if the loaded book is a CTG book. When set to ```true```, the engine will only play Green moves from the book (if any). If no green moves found, then no book move is made
This option has no effect or use if the loaded book is a Polyglot (BIN) book
    
#### CTG/BIN Book 2 File
Same explaination as **CTG/BIN Book 1 File**, but for the second book

#### Book 2 Width
Same explaination as **BIN Book 1 Width**, but for the second book

#### Book 2 Depth
Same explaination as **BIN Book 1 Depth**, but for the second book

#### (CTG) Book 2 Only Green
Same explaination as **(CTG) Book 1 Only Green**, but for the second book

#### UCI commands
Polyfish supports all UCI commands supported by Stockfish. *Click [here](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/README.md#the-uci-protocol-and-available-options) to see the full list of supported Stockfish UCI commands*

Polyfish also supports the following UCI commands

  * ##### book
    This command causes the engine to show available moves and associated information from the currently configured books

#### Note about CTG books:
CTG book format specification is not available to the public from Chessbase. The code that reads and parses CTG books is based on the reverse engineered book specification published on [CTG Specifications](https://web.archive.org/web/20210129162445/https://rybkaforum.net/cgi-bin/rybkaforum/topic_show.pl?tid=2319) as well as the other resources mentioned earlier.

The reverse engineered specs are good enough to proble the book for moves, but it does not provide the same functionality as Chessbase own products. The following is a list of known limitations of **Polyfish**'s CTG book implementation:
- Does not support underpromotion, which means all promotion moves are assumed to be to a Queen
- Does not support more than two Queens on the board
- The logic that determines Green/Red moves is not 100% accurate which may cause the engine not to play certain Green moves because it cannot identify them.
- Some move annotations and engine recommendations can be read.

The move weight calculated by **Polyfish** (can be seen using the **book** command) is my own attempt to compensate for all the missing/unknown information about the CTG specification. Using the calculated weight, **Polyfish** can pick the best move for a given position in 99% of the times because it ustilizes existing move statistics such as number of wins, draws, and losses, as well as "known" annotations (!, !?, ?!, ??, OnlyMove, etc...) and recommendations (Green vs. Red) if available.

Despite the fact that Polyfish can read and play from CTG Book, it is not going to be identical to Chessbase own products since it is based on the partial CTG specification available publicly. Use at your own risk!

#### Live Book section (thanks to Eman's author Khalid Omar for windows builds)

##### Live Book (checkbox)

_Boolean, Default: False_ If activated, the engine uses the livebook as primary choice.

##### Live Book URL
The default is the online [chessdb](https://www.chessdb.cn/queryc_en/), a wonderful project by noobpwnftw (thanks to him!)
 
[https://github.com/noobpwnftw/chessdb](https://github.com/noobpwnftw/chessdb)

[http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=71764&hilit=chessdb](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=71764&hilit=chessdb)

The private application can also learn from this live db.

##### Live Book Timeout

_Default 5000, min 0, max 10000_ Only for bullet games, use a lower value, for example, 1500.

##### Live Book Retry

_Default 3, min 1, max 100_ Max times the engine tries to contribute (if the corresponding option is activated: see below) to the live book. If 0, the engine doesn't use the livebook.

##### Live Book Diversity

_Boolean, Default: False_ If activated, the engine varies its play, reducing conversely its strength because already the live chessdb is very large.

##### Live Book Contribute

_Boolean, Default: False_ If activated, the engine sends a move, not in live chessdb, in its queue to be analysed. In this manner, we have a kind of learning cloud.

##### Live Book Depth

_Default 100, min 1, max 100_ Depth of live book moves.

### Opening variety

_Integer, Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 40_
To play different opening lines from default (0), if not from book (see below).
Higher variety -> more probable loss of ELO

### Concurrent Experience

_Boolean, Default: False_ 
Set this option to true when running under CuteChess and you experiences problems with concurrency > 1
When this option is true, the saved experience file name will be modified to something like experience-64a4c665c57504a4.bin
(64a4c665c57504a4 is random). Each concurrent instance of BrainLearn will have its own experience file name, however, all the concurrent instances will read "experience.bin" at start up.

## pgn_to_bl_converter

Converting pgn to brainlearn format is really simple.

Requirements
1. Download cuteChess gui
2. Download brainlearn
3. Download stockfish or equivalent
3. Download the pgn files you want to convert

In Cute Chess, set a tournament according to the photo in this link:
[CuteChess Settings](https://github.com/amchess/BrainLearn/tree/master/doc/pgn_to_bl.PNG)

- Add the 2 engines (One should be brainlearn)

-start a tournament with brainlearn and any other engine. It will convert all the games in the pgn file and save them to game.bin

Note: We recommend you use games from high quality play.

## Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/official-stockfish/Stockfish.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/official-stockfish/Stockfish)
[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/official-stockfish/Stockfish?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mcostalba/stockfish/branch/master)

[Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org) is a free, powerful UCI chess engine
derived from Glaurung 2.1. Stockfish is not a complete chess program and requires a
UCI-compatible graphical user interface (GUI) (e.g. XBoard with PolyGlot, Scid,
Cute Chess, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, Shredder, Chess Partner or Fritz) in order
to be used comfortably. Read the documentation for your GUI of choice for information
about how to use Stockfish with it.

The Stockfish engine features two evaluation functions for chess, the classical
evaluation based on handcrafted terms, and the NNUE evaluation based on efficiently
updateable neural networks. The classical evaluation runs efficiently on almost all
CPU architectures, while the NNUE evaluation benefits from the vector
intrinsics available on most CPUs (sse2, avx2, neon, or similar).


## Files

This distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:

  * Readme.md, the file you are currently reading.

  * Copying.txt, a text file containing the GNU General Public License version 3.

  * src, a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile
    that can be used to compile Stockfish on Unix-like systems.

  * a file with the .nnue extension, storing the neural network for the NNUE 
    evaluation. Binary distributions will have this file embedded.

Note: to use the NNUE evaluation, the additional data file with neural network parameters
needs to be available. Normally, this file is already embedded in the binary or it can be downloaded.
The filename for the default (recommended) net can be found as the default
value of the `EvalFile` UCI option, with the format `nn-[SHA256 first 12 digits].nnue`
(for instance, `nn-c157e0a5755b.nnue`). This file can be downloaded from
```
https://tests.stockfishchess.org/api/nn/[filename]
```
replacing `[filename]` as needed.


## UCI options

Currently, Stockfish has the following UCI options:

  * #### Threads
    The number of CPU threads used for searching a position. For best performance, set
    this equal to the number of CPU cores available.

  * #### Hash
    The size of the hash table in MB. It is recommended to set Hash after setting Threads.

  * #### Ponder
    Let Stockfish ponder its next move while the opponent is thinking.

  * #### MultiPV
    Output the N best lines (principal variations, PVs) when searching.
    Leave at 1 for best performance.

  * #### Use NNUE
    Toggle between the NNUE and classical evaluation functions. If set to "true",
    the network parameters must be available to load from file (see also EvalFile),
    if they are not embedded in the binary.

  * #### EvalFile
    The name of the file of the NNUE evaluation parameters. Depending on the GUI the
    filename might have to include the full path to the folder/directory that contains the file.
    Other locations, such as the directory that contains the binary and the working directory,
    are also searched.

  * #### UCI_AnalyseMode
    An option handled by your GUI.

  * #### UCI_Chess960
    An option handled by your GUI. If true, Stockfish will play Chess960.

  * #### UCI_ShowWDL
    If enabled, show approximate WDL statistics as part of the engine output.
    These WDL numbers model expected game outcomes for a given evaluation and
    game ply for engine self-play at fishtest LTC conditions (60+0.6s per game).

  * #### UCI_LimitStrength
    Enable weaker play aiming for an Elo rating as set by UCI_Elo. This option overrides Skill Level.

  * #### UCI_Elo
    If enabled by UCI_LimitStrength, aim for an engine strength of the given Elo.
    This Elo rating has been calibrated at a time control of 60s+0.6s and anchored to CCRL 40/4.

  * #### Skill Level
    Lower the Skill Level in order to make Stockfish play weaker (see also UCI_LimitStrength).
    Internally, MultiPV is enabled, and with a certain probability depending on the Skill Level a
    weaker move will be played.

  * #### SyzygyPath
    Path to the folders/directories storing the Syzygy tablebase files. Multiple
    directories are to be separated by ";" on Windows and by ":" on Unix-based
    operating systems. Do not use spaces around the ";" or ":".

    Example: `C:\tablebases\wdl345;C:\tablebases\wdl6;D:\tablebases\dtz345;D:\tablebases\dtz6`

    It is recommended to store .rtbw files on an SSD. There is no loss in storing
    the .rtbz files on a regular HD. It is recommended to verify all md5 checksums
    of the downloaded tablebase files (`md5sum -c checksum.md5`) as corruption will
    lead to engine crashes.

  * #### SyzygyProbeDepth
    Minimum remaining search depth for which a position is probed. Set this option
    to a higher value to probe less agressively if you experience too much slowdown
    (in terms of nps) due to TB probing.

  * #### Syzygy50MoveRule
    Disable to let fifty-move rule draws detected by Syzygy tablebase probes count
    as wins or losses. This is useful for ICCF correspondence games.

  * #### SyzygyProbeLimit
    Limit Syzygy tablebase probing to positions with at most this many pieces left
    (including kings and pawns).

  * #### Contempt
    A positive value for contempt favors middle game positions and avoids draws,
    effective for the classical evaluation only.

  * #### Analysis Contempt
    By default, contempt is set to prefer the side to move. Set this option to "White"
    or "Black" to analyse with contempt for that side, or "Off" to disable contempt.

  * #### Move Overhead
    Assume a time delay of x ms due to network and GUI overheads. This is useful to
    avoid losses on time in those cases.
  
  * ####  Minimum Thinking Time (old Stockfish option restored)
	Search for at least x ms per move.
  
  * #### Slow Mover
    Lower values will make Stockfish take less time in games, higher values will
    make it think longer.

  * #### nodestime
    Tells the engine to use nodes searched instead of wall time to account for
    elapsed time. Useful for engine testing.

  * #### Clear Hash
    Clear the hash table.

  * #### Debug Log File
    Write all communication to and from the engine into a text file.

## A note on classical and NNUE evaluation

Both approaches assign a value to a position that is used in alpha-beta (PVS) search
to find the best move. The classical evaluation computes this value as a function
of various chess concepts, handcrafted by experts, tested and tuned using fishtest.
The NNUE evaluation computes this value with a neural network based on basic
inputs (e.g. piece positions only). The network is optimized and trained
on the evaluations of millions of positions at moderate search depth.

The NNUE evaluation was first introduced in shogi, and ported to Stockfish afterward.
It can be evaluated efficiently on CPUs, and exploits the fact that only parts
of the neural network need to be updated after a typical chess move.
[The nodchip repository](https://github.com/nodchip/Stockfish) provides additional
tools to train and develop the NNUE networks.

On CPUs supporting modern vector instructions (avx2 and similar), the NNUE evaluation
results in stronger playing strength, even if the nodes per second computed by the engine
is somewhat lower (roughly 60% of nps is typical).

Note that the NNUE evaluation depends on the Stockfish binary and the network parameter
file (see EvalFile). Not every parameter file is compatible with a given Stockfish binary.
The default value of the EvalFile UCI option is the name of a network that is guaranteed
to be compatible with that binary.

## What to expect from Syzygybases?

If the engine is searching a position that is not in the tablebases (e.g.
a position with 8 pieces), it will access the tablebases during the search.
If the engine reports a very large score (typically 153.xx), this means
that it has found a winning line into a tablebase position.

If the engine is given a position to search that is in the tablebases, it
will use the tablebases at the beginning of the search to preselect all
good moves, i.e. all moves that preserve the win or preserve the draw while
taking into account the 50-move rule.
It will then perform a search only on those moves. **The engine will not move
immediately**, unless there is only a single good move. **The engine likely
will not report a mate score even if the position is known to be won.**

It is therefore clear that this behaviour is not identical to what one might
be used to with Nalimov tablebases. There are technical reasons for this
difference, the main technical reason being that Nalimov tablebases use the
DTM metric (distance-to-mate), while Syzygybases use a variation of the
DTZ metric (distance-to-zero, zero meaning any move that resets the 50-move
counter). This special metric is one of the reasons that Syzygybases are
more compact than Nalimov tablebases, while still storing all information
needed for optimal play and in addition being able to take into account
the 50-move rule.

## Large Pages

Stockfish supports large pages on Linux and Windows. Large pages make
the hash access more efficient, improving the engine speed, especially
on large hash sizes. Typical increases are 5..10% in terms of nodes per
second, but speed increases up to 30% have been measured. The support is
automatic. Stockfish attempts to use large pages when available and
will fall back to regular memory allocation when this is not the case.

### Support on Linux

Large page support on Linux is obtained by the Linux kernel
transparent huge pages functionality. Typically, transparent huge pages
are already enabled and no configuration is needed.

### Support on Windows

The use of large pages requires "Lock Pages in Memory" privilege. See
[Enable the Lock Pages in Memory Option (Windows)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows)
on how to enable this privilege, then run [RAMMap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap)
to double-check that large pages are used. We suggest that you reboot
your computer after you have enabled large pages, because long Windows
sessions suffer from memory fragmentation which may prevent Stockfish
from getting large pages: a fresh session is better in this regard.

## Compiling Stockfish yourself from the sources

Stockfish has support for 32 or 64-bit CPUs, certain hardware
instructions, big-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.

On Unix-like systems, it should be easy to compile Stockfish
directly from the source code with the included Makefile in the folder
`src`. In general it is recommended to run `make help` to see a list of make
targets with corresponding descriptions.

```
    cd src
    make help
    make net
    make build ARCH=x86-64-modern
```

When not using the Makefile to compile (for instance with Microsoft MSVC) you
need to manually set/unset some switches in the compiler command line; see
file *types.h* for a quick reference.

When reporting an issue or a bug, please tell us which version and
compiler you used to create your executable. These informations can
be found by typing the following commands in a console:

```
    ./stockfish compiler
```

## Understanding the code base and participating in the project

Stockfish's improvement over the last couple of years has been a great
community effort. There are a few ways to help contribute to its growth.

### Donating hardware

Improving Stockfish requires a massive amount of testing. You can donate
your hardware resources by installing the [Fishtest Worker](https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/wiki/Running-the-worker:-overview)
and view the current tests on [Fishtest](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests).

### Improving the code

If you want to help improve the code, there are several valuable resources:

* [In this wiki,](https://www.chessprogramming.org) many techniques used in
Stockfish are explained with a lot of background information.

* [The section on Stockfish](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish)
describes many features and techniques used by Stockfish. However, it is
generic rather than being focused on Stockfish's precise implementation.
Nevertheless, a helpful resource.

* The latest source can always be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish).
Discussions about Stockfish take place in the [FishCooking](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fishcooking)
group and engine testing is done on [Fishtest](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests).
If you want to help improve Stockfish, please read this [guideline](https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/wiki/Creating-my-first-test)
first, where the basics of Stockfish development are explained.
